## Getting Started

To use the "Web-based Job Opportunity Analyzer," follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 nltk
```

2. Import the necessary libraries in your Python script:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
```

3. Define the `Job` class to store job details:
```python
class Job:
    def __init__(self, title, company, location, salary, qualifications, description, sentiment):
        self.title = title
        self.company = company
        self.location = location
        self.salary = salary
        self.qualifications = qualifications
        self.description = description
        self.sentiment = sentiment

    def print_job_details(self):
        print("Job Title:", self.title)
        print("Company:", self.company)
        print("Location:", self.location)
        print("Salary:", self.salary)
        print("Qualifications:")
        for qualification in self.qualifications:
            print("-", qualification)
        print("Sentiment Score:", self.sentiment)
```

4. Define the `JobScraper` class to scrape job listings:
```python
class JobScraper:
    def __init__(self, websites, search_keywords):
        self.websites = websites
        self.search_keywords = search_keywords
        self.sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
        nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

    def scrape_jobs(self, website, keyword):
        # Function implementation

    def extract_job_details(self, job):
        # Function implementation

    def scrape_all_jobs(self):
        # Function implementation
```

5. Define the `main` function to initiate the scraping process:
```python
def main():
    websites = [
        "https://www.indeed.com",
        "https://www.linkedin.com",
        "https://www.glassdoor.com"
    ]

    search_keywords = [
        "Data Scientist",
        "Software Engineer",
        "Product Manager"
    ]

    scraper = JobScraper(websites, search_keywords)
    scraper.scrape_all_jobs()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

6. Run your Python script to start scraping job opportunities from the specified websites and with the provided search keywords.
